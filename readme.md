#Show Control for Transmedia Projects	
This application was the backbone of the Showcontrol system for Wolf 359's project "Temping" at the 53rd New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center. 

##Usage
this program sends emails to audience members during a live performance. the interface is point-and click, but I have plans to incorporate it into a larger project. 


####use this app only for good. 

##Setup
You'll need to setup an account at Mailgun, add that information to the rails app, and then define the audience user email account, as well as the type in the content of the emails in the Mailers folder. 

then deploy to either heroku, or run locally using the local rails server.
