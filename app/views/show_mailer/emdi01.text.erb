Hello <%= @greeting %>! Wish I could be there to welcome you in person but I’ve got a client offsite. 

I asked Sarah Jane to document her work so you could just pick that up where she left off. She said she sent you an email? 

So glad to have you on the team!
Think it’s gonna be a great year for us.
Yrs,
Diego
