Hello,

You're getting this automatic message because you're having trouble attaching a file to an email, or someone thinks you're having trouble, or you are just generally clueless about technology and I KNOW you're going to ask me about this later.

How to attach a file to an email:
Create an email (Control+N or hit the “Reply” button)
Open the folder with the file you want
Click on the file and drag it to the body of your email
YOU DID IT

Alternate Method:
Create an email, or for an existing email, click Reply, Reply All, or Forward.
In the message window, on the Message tab, click Attach File.
Browse to and click the file that you want to attach, and then click Insert.

Thanks,
Allison (IT)
